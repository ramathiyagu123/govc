# govc-openshift4-vmware

Deploy OpenShift 4.3 and later using static IP addresses for master and worker nodes.  It will upload the OpenShift Bare Metal BIOS file and ignition files to a websever, and will create a bootable ISO for each node with static IP configuration and ignition parameters already set.

## Prereqs

1. [DNS](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/installing/installing_vsphere/installing-vsphere.html#installation-dns-user-infra_installing-vsphere) needs to be configured ahead of time
2. [Loadbalancers](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/installing/installing_vsphere/installing-vsphere.html#installation-network-user-infra_installing-vsphere) need to be configured ahead of time
3. An existing webserver that can serve files to the OpenShift nodes for ignition.

## Installation Process

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ncolon/govc-openshift4-vmware
$ cd govc-openshift4-vmware
$ cp environemnt.properties.example environment.properties
```

Update your environment.properties with your environment values and run `install.sh`
